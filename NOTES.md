# Notes

Working notes for this project. I read this in the morning and leave feedback
under a dated heading; the agent reads the newest feedback, does the work, and
appends its own account below.

## Feedback — 2026-08-18

Finance flagged something odd on the monthly page: later summaries listed
categories from earlier months with a total of 0.00. Fixed — `summarise` was
accumulating categories in a module-level list instead of deriving them from
the entries it was given.

## Feedback — 2026-08-19

Two things from the finance review this morning.

First, the summary should say how many entries went into it. They want to see
`count` next to the total so they can spot a month where the importer dropped
rows — a month with a plausible total and forty entries instead of four hundred
is the failure mode they keep missing.

Second, the detail table under each summary wants to show every entry's share
of the month. The simplest thing is to have `summarise` write the month's total
onto each entry as it goes — set `entry["month_total"]` while you are summing —
and then the table can just read it off the entry and divide. Please wire that
up.

`docs/ledger.md` is the page the finance team reads, so keep it true.
